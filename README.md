# CarbonVista

## Inspiration
Our team was inspired by [this](https://streets.mn/2019/09/06/graphic-whats-a-vehicles-carbon-footprint/) site, which developed a formula to calculate carbon emissions from vehicles. Using our web development knowledge, we decided to implement this very formula in the form of a website.
## What it does
Our website calculates how many pounds of gallons the user's vehicle emits per day. 
## How we built it
We created our website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge that we ran into was creating a form that would successfully output a value reflective of the user's carbon footprint, given the lack of JavaScript experience of most of the team members. Another challenge was compiling a list of vehicles for the user to choose from, which was difficult considering the multitude of cars in the market.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned

## What's next for Carbon Vista
In the future, we hope to implement features that will take into account the carbon footprint from other sources such as grocery sources, individual transportation alternatives, and electricity usage.
